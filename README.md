# MBTI Personality Classifier 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nathalie-Elinor-Abu/mais-hacks-2020.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nathalie-Elinor-Abu/mais-hacks-2020) 

This project was built for [MAIS Hacks 2020](https://maishacks.com/), a 24 HR virtual AI hackathon. Our goal was to build a simple machine learning model to apply (MBTI) Myers-Briggs Type Indicators to Twitter users based on tweet data gathered from the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs). 

Project made with caffeine and tears by [Nathalie](https://github.com/nredick), [Elinor](https://github.com/elinorpd) and [Abu](https://github.com/abubakardaud).

## Project Description

The dataset used to train the model was the [(MBTI) Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). The model makes a prediction based on data gathered from the users tweets and classifies them into one of the 16 MBTI types. The webapp is built on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
